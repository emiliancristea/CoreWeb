CoreWeb Development Plan (V1.1)
Version: 1.1Date: April 26, 2025
Overview
CoreWeb is a C++-based framework for building lightweight, secure, and cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. It integrates a C++20 backend with system webviews and a React/TypeScript frontend, offering a robust plugin system, a command-line interface (CLI), and example applications. CoreWeb aims to surpass Tauri and Electron in performance, security, and developer experience.
Key Components

Core Backend: Manages logic, project management, plugins, and configurations using C++20.
Control Center Client: A React/TypeScript/Tailwind CSS interface rendered via C++-managed webview.
CLI Tool: coreweb-cli for scaffolding, building, and running projects.
Plugin System: Extensible via C++ modules and WebAssembly (WASM) with secure APIs.
Example Apps: Demonstrations of capabilities (e.g., productivity, utility, creative apps).

Goals

Achieve minimal resource usage (~3–5 MB binaries, ~15–25 MB memory, 200–400 ms startup).
Ensure security through sandboxing, modern C++ practices, and static analysis.
Guarantee cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Provide a seamless developer experience with CLI, hot-reloading, TypeScript support, and comprehensive documentation.

Technology Stack

C++ Backend: C++20, webview (system webview integration), nlohmann/json (JSON handling), cpp-httplib (HTTP server/IPC), sqlite3 (storage), libcurl (networking), Wasmer (WASM runtime).
Frontend: React (18.x), TypeScript (5.x), Tailwind CSS (3.x), Webpack (5.x).
Testing: GoogleTest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E/UI), custom scripts.
Build: CMake, vcpkg for dependency management.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions.
