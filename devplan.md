CoreWeb Development Plan (V1.4)
Version: 1.4
Date: April 26, 2025
Overview
CoreWeb is an open-source, C++-based framework designed to build lightweight, secure, and cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). It leverages system webviews (WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux) and a C++20 backend to deliver a high-performance alternative to Tauri and Electron. CoreWeb emphasizes minimal resource usage, robust security, seamless developer experience, accessibility, localization, and strong community adoption, drawing inspiration from frameworks like Molybden (Molybden) and Sciter (Sciter).
Key Components
•	Core Backend: Manages application logic, plugins, configurations, and i18n/a11y data using C++20, with optional Rust FFI bindings for enhanced security.
•	CLI Tool: coreweb-cli for project scaffolding, building, running, plugin management, live reloading, and performance visualization via a dashboard.
•	Plugin System: Extensible via native (C++/Rust) and web (WASM/JS/TS) plugins, with a hosted registry and standardized APIs for common use cases (e.g., file system, notifications).
•	Example Apps: Demonstrations of desktop capabilities, showcasing C++-JavaScript integration, native/web plugins, and i18n/a11y with React, Vue, and Svelte frontends.
•	Starter Kit: Pre-configured templates for React, Vue, and Svelte, including i18n/a11y boilerplate and C++-JavaScript communication examples.
Goals
•	Achieve minimal resource usage: ~3–5 MB binaries, ~15–25 MB memory, 200–400 ms startup time.
•	Ensure robust security through sandboxing, modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, RAII), static analysis (Clang-Tidy), capability-based plugin access, and optional Rust bindings.
•	Guarantee cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux, with consistent webview behavior.
•	Provide a seamless developer experience with a polished CLI, hot-reloading, plugin templates, VS Code integration, and WebAssembly debugging.
•	Foster community adoption through a hosted plugin registry, public roadmap, examples gallery, contribution guides, and governance via a CoreWeb Foundation or open-source body.
•	Support accessibility (a11y) with ARIA-compliant webviews and native hooks, and localization (i18n) with translation file management.
Technology Stack
•	C++ Backend: C++20, webview (WebView2, WKWebView, WebKitGTK), nlohmann/json (nlohmann/json) for JSON handling, cpp-httplib (cpp-httplib) for HTTP server/IPC, sqlite3 for storage, libcurl for networking, Wasmer (Wasmer) for WASM runtime with Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation, Rust FFI for optional bindings.
•	Frontend: Framework-agnostic, supports JavaScript/TypeScript frontends (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) via webview, with minification via Webpack (Webpack) or Rollup (Rollup).
•	Testing: 
o	C++: GoogleTest (GoogleTest) for unit/integration, RapidCheck (RapidCheck) for property-based testing, AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (ASan/UBSan) for memory safety.
o	Frontend: Jest (Jest) for unit/integration, Puppeteer (Puppeteer) or Playwright (Playwright) for E2E web content testing.
o	Binary Size: Bloaty (Bloaty) for analysis.
•	Build: CMake (CMake) for build system, vcpkg (vcpkg) for dependency management, incremental compilation for faster builds.
•	CI/CD: GitHub Actions (GitHub Actions) with cross-platform matrix testing (Windows, macOS, Linux).
•	Tooling: Tracy (Tracy) for profiling with presets, Clang-Tidy (Clang-Tidy) for static analysis, VS Code extension for debugging and CLI integration, DWARF support for WebAssembly debugging.
Development Phases
The plan is divided into four phases, each with detailed tasks, testing strategies, documentation updates, and Git commit points. Tasks are actionable, with implementation guidance inspired by Molybden’s C++-JavaScript integration (Molybden Docs) and Sciter’s embeddable UI engine (Sciter Docs).

o	Details: 
	Documentation: 
	Tutorials: Project setup, plugin development, i18n/a11y integration, and porting from Tauri/Electron.
	API Reference: Doxygen-generated docs for C++ APIs, Markdown for CLI and JavaScript APIs.
	FAQs: Common issues (e.g., webview runtime errors, plugin permission conflicts).
	Best Practices: Security (e.g., sanitizing IPC inputs), performance (e.g., minimizing DOM), and a11y (e.g., using aria-live).
	Community Tools: 
	Public Roadmap: Host on GitHub Projects, outlining features (e.g., mobile support, V8 snapshots) and timelines.
	Examples Gallery: Deploy a static website (e.g., via GitHub Pages) showcasing example apps and community contributions, with screenshots and live demos.
	Contribution Incentives: Recognize contributors in /docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md and the gallery.
	Funding: Promote Open Collective for donations to support CI/CD, registry hosting, and documentation.
	Deploy documentation to a static site (e.g., MkDocs (MkDocs)) with search functionality.
o	Testing: Validate documentation completeness (e.g., all APIs documented) and website functionality (e.g., gallery links work).
o	Documentation: Finalize /docs with all guides, deploy to https://coreweb.dev/docs (or similar).
o	Git Commit: "Finalize documentation and community tools"
Deliverable: A production-ready CoreWeb framework with example apps demonstrating C++-JavaScript integration, native/web plugins, i18n/a11y, cross-platform support, optimized performance, comprehensive E2E testing, and robust community tools.
Summary
CoreWeb Development Plan (V1.4) provides a complete, actionable roadmap for building a lightweight, secure, and cross-platform C++ framework for desktop applications. Enhanced with detailed tasks for webview integration, two-way IPC, native/web plugins, a hosted registry, i18n/a11y, performance optimization, E2E testing, and community adoption, it draws inspiration from Molybden, Sciter, Tauri, and Electron. Each phase includes granular implementation guidance, rigorous testing, and comprehensive documentation to ensure CoreWeb rivals Tauri’s performance and security while surpassing Electron’s efficiency, with a strong foundation for community-driven development.
